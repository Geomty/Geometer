# Geometer
My first ever Discord bot and coding project, created mostly in 2020. I used to work on this for hours every day, adding any possible command I could think of. It had moderation commands, fun commands, and a whole economy system, although most of the code was [quite messy](https://github.com/Geomty/Geometer/blob/main/utils/paginator.js).
###### also this was before discord switched to slash commands so everything here is very outdated
